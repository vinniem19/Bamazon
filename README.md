# Bamazon

 The Bamazon app is a command line interface that acts like amazon.  It displays products in a table format.
 The customer is prompted with two questions:
1. What item ID would you like to purchase?
1. How many would you like to purchase?

 When customer answers those questions, the app displays the item, quantity, and the total amount of
 the purchase.  The bamazon db is updated with a new inventory. Then, the customer is asked if they 
 would like to make another purchase? When the answer is no, the app thanks them and exits.
